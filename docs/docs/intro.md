# Getting Started

Welcome to Raise More!

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to set up your account and start fundraising. With Raise More, you can streamline your fundraising process and easily manage your donor data.

## Sign up and log in

To get started, go to www.raisemore.com and click get started. Then, sign up using your Google account. There's no need to create a separate username and password. Once you log in, you can add unlimited team members to your organization, which makes it more secure and convenient to share account information.

## Onboarding

### 1. Create Your Organization

After you log in, you'll be prompted to create your organization and give it a name. You'll also need to enter the type of organization, such as "congressional campaign," "state legislature campaign," or "nonprofit." This helps us customize the platform for you.

### 2. Choose An Area Code For Your Dialer's Caller Id

Next, you'll need to choose an area code for your dialer's caller ID (e.g. 202). This is the number that will show up when you're dialing contacts. It's important to choose a number that your donors and prospects are familiar with, so they're more likely to answer your calls.

### 3. Set Up Actblue Sync

If you have an ActBlue account, you'll want to set up ActBlue sync. This will import your ActBlue data into Raise More to fill in donation history and donor contact details, and keep it integrated into the future. If you don't want to do it right now, you can set up ActBlue sync later by clicking "ActBlue Sync" under "Settings" in the left-hand application menu bar. There you'll find instructions to generate "API credentials" to connect your ActBlue account to Raise More.

### 4. Upload Other Contact Info and Spreadsheets

Now you'll be looking an an import screen, with the option of uploading prior donations, current prospects, or a list of prior pledges.

-   Donors: This is an alternative to syncing with ActBlue. The file format you'll need is a .csv and the required and optional fields are listed on the import page.
-   Prospects: This is a list of people you want to call to ask for a donation. The file format you'll need is a .csv and the required and optional fields are listed on the import page.
-   Pledges: This is a list of people who have already pledged to donate to your campaign or organization but haven't fufilled those pledges yes. The file format you'll need is a .csv and the required and optional fields are listed on the import page.

### 5. You're Done Onboarding!

Congratulations, you've completed the onboarding process! Now let's move on to the next steps.

## Go To The Dashboard

Once you've uploaded your data, go to the dashboard to see an overview of your fundraising progress. You'll be able to see your total amount raised, your call activity, and unfufilled pledges.

## Try Out Quick Search

Use the quick search feature to find specific people. To do this, click on the floating search bar at the top middle of the page and enter any part of their name. Clicking on an entry will bring you to their profile page.

## Create A List

To create a list of prospects to call, use the "Create a List" button on the left-hand application menu bar. You can select specific criteria to filter people (both your donors and prospects) and create a targeted list. This will help you organize and focus your outreach efforts.

## Start A Call Session With That List

Once you have created a list, you can start a call session with that list.

To do this, click on the "Make Calls" button on the lefthand application menu bar.

Then, select the list you want to call from the dropdown menu.

## Make Your First Calls

Now you will see a dialer view that looks similar to the profile view, but with dialer controls at the control.

You'll see a prompt to enter your cell phone number, and then a number that you should call with your phone in order to connect to the dialer audio.

Once you do this, you'll see the "call," "skip," and "hang up" buttons go from disabled to active.

Click "call" to make your first dial!

## Process Your First Interaction

Once you have made your first call, you'll see "call disposition" buttons become enabled with titles like "Not home", "Wrong number", "Pledged", etc.

Click on the appropriate button to record the outcome of your call.

You can also take notes, and add the exact value of any pledge.

Once you're finished, click "Save Interaction".

## Proceed To The Next Call

Once you have saved your interaction, you'll see the "Next" button become enabled at the top right.

That's the basics on the how the dialer works -- you can always skip a person before you call them, or hangup mid call, but once you make a call you'll need to record some kind of disposition before you can proceed to the next call. That's to make sure that recordkeeping is actually happening and no note gets lost by accident.
